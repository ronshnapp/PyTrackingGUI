General:
========

This is a simple python based GUI used for manually tracking objects in series of images.

To use it, you'll need to have Python3 working on your PC along with Tkinter (using the anaconda distribution is highly recommended).




Instructions:
=============

Run gui1.py through python. Then:

1) choose a series of images with an object to track through "select files"  
2) use the buttons/arrow keys to navigate, and +/- keys to zoom in or out
3) for each image, click the object you are tracking
4) save the results (object's coordinates) as tab separated vaues

Important warning - don't drink and track!
